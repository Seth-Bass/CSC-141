There is no one real topic that really interest me.

I have just never been that kind ofo person.

I am more of a jack of all trades.

I just want to learn as much as I can.

That way I can have as much of an advantage as I can when I face problems.

After all, there is nothing really wrong with learning as much as you can right?
