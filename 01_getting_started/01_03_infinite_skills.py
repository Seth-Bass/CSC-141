If I were to have infinite skills and knowledge in programing, there would only be one thing that would want to do.

I would want to make fun games.

Not games that make you play only to take your money away from you.

Not games that want to play them for as long as possible.

I simply want to make games that people will enjoy because that will make they want to play them again.

It will make them check out others games I made that were made for the purpose for people to just have fun.
